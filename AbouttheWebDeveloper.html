    <h1>About Katharine</h1>
    <p>Hello, My name is Katharine and I this website is a project for a Web Development class.  I am extremely new to Web Development and this is the very first web page I have ever attempted to develop.  I chose Grant Park, the Chicago Lakefront, and the Chicago Riverwalk as the topic of my "visitor" website because I live in the Loop and often encounter tourists in my day-to-day life.  I am also very interested in Chicago history.</p>

    <p> My family has been in Chicago for several generations.  In fact, I decended from people who owned and managed a Boarding House that sat just north of the Chicago River behind what is now the Reid-Murdoch Building.  They were displaced by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871</p>
