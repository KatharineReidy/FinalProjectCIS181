                <h2>About Katharine</h2>
                    Hello, My name is Katharine and this website is a project for a Web Development class.  I am extremely new to Web Development and this is the very first website I have ever attempted to develop. I am studying Digital Marketing and Social Media Management at Harold Washington College. I am employed as a substitute teacher for Chicago Public Schools.
                <h2>Project Information</h2>
                    <p>The assignment for this class was to create a website about a place we want to visit.  I live in the Loop and encounter tourists in my day-to-day life. So, I decided to create a website that could be useful to people who visit my neighborhood. </p>   
                    <p>I have been researching my family history and have learned that my family has been in this city for five generations.  Some of my earliest migranting ancestors owned and managed a Boarding House that sat just north of the Chicago River behind what is now the Reid-Murdoch Building. They were displaced by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.</p>
