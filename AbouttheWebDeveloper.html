                <p>The website is a     project for my Web Development Class.  I am new to web development and this is the first website I have ever attempted to create.  The assignment asked for us to create a website about a place we would like to visit.  I like visit the parks near my home.  I also see many tourists in my neighborhood.  So, I decided to create a website that could be useful to people who visit my neighborhood. </p> 
                <p> I shot and edited all photography & video on this website. I used Canva to create & edit the imagery for this website.</p>
