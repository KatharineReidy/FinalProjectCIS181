        <h1> Welcome to the Parks & Greenspaces of Chicago's Loop</h1>
            <p>Chicago downtown center is famously called "the Loop".  When people think of the Loop, they usually think about skyscrapers, the "el", traffic, and crowds.  But, did you know that the Loop is also the home of world class parks, a waterway hub, and recreation opportunities that are open to the public? In this website we will explore all that Chicago’s Lakefront Park, Grant Park, the Chicago Riverwalk have to offer.  Enjoy learning what awaits you in Chicago's Loop. We hope to see you soon! </p>
