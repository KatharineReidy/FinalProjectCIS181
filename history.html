            <h1>Chicago Loop History - A Walk Through Time</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>The Chicago Loop sits at the base of the Chicago River Watershed, an area that has important historical significance dating back much further than the city itself.</p>

                    <p>The Chicago River connects to Lake Michigan in Chicago’s Loop. Lake Michigan is part of the Great Lakes in North America, an interconnected group of exceptionally large lakes which empties into the St. Lawerence Seaway and then the Atlantic Ocean. The Chicagoland area sits on a sub-continental divide. Rivers and streams to the east of this divide (generally) flow to Lake Michigan. Rivers and streams to the west of this divide flow into the Illinois River which begins near Joliet, IL. The Illinois River flows through Illinois and connects with the Mississippi River near St. Louis. Traditionally the area between these two major watersheds was a muddy flooded area in what is now the SW side of the city. It was called Mud Lake. </p>

                    <P>These areas were the home to and important trade routes for numerous Indigenous American tribes for thousands of years. The Council of Three Fires, which includes the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations, called this place home. Other tribes like the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac, Fox, Kickapoo, and Illinois nations had important trade routes and other important ties to this area. Visitors to Chicago who are interested in learning more about the people who are indigenous to this area might consider visiting the Chicago History Museum, the Newberry Library, The Field Museum, or the Chicago Maritime History Museum. </P>

                    <p>European Missionaries traveled through the area in the Mid 1600s. Marquette and Joliet traveled in this area, guided by local tribes. As they traveled from the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes, they were guided up the Illinois River and over a portage to the Chicago River. Marquette noted that it would be a good place to build a canal. </p>

                    <p>In the late 15th Century, Europeans concocted a legal framework called “The Doctrine of Discovery” which asserted religious-political justification for Christian Europeans to claim land on other continents. Under this framework, France “claimed the land where Chicago now sits as part of its empire. French Traders began appearing in the area in the 1730’s and joined the already established trade lines in the area. </p>

                    <p>DuSable was the first non-native settler to the Chicago River Watershed. He was of African descent and is theorized by many to be from Saint Dominque, (now Haiti). He settled in the Chicago area in the 1780’s and married Kitahawa (also known as Catherine) who was a Potawatomi woman with strong kinship ties. </p>

                    <p>After the American Revolution, Virginians invaded and claimed Illinois as part of their state based on “right by conquest” but later ceded the area to the US and it became part of the Northwest Territory. During this time, indigenous tribes were often forced out of the areas of what is now the Great Lakes States region. In 1830, The Indian Removal Act was signed into law which forced all the Indigenous Tribes to move west of the Mississippi River. The Indigenous tribes actively protested these laws. In 1833, the Treaty of Chicago was signed. One group of Potawatomi stayed near the Des Plaines River in protest until 1837.</p> 

                    <p> The population of Chicago boomed during the 1800s. It was a frontier town of a few thousand people in 1800 and grew to the size of over 1 million people by 1890. This growth was made possible by the building of canals that linked the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River Watershed. In 1824, plans for the Illinois & Michigan Canal were finalized, and building of the canal began in 1836. It linked the South Branch of the Chicago River (in the Bridgeport Neighborhood) to the Illinois Rive at LaSalle-Peru. </p>

                    <p>Chicago had a major event in October of 1871 when a large fire destroyed most of the city. It displaced a half-million people. The aftermath of the fire was a surge in building projects and a foundation for the city that exists today. </p>

                    <p>Canals and waterways saw improvements. The I&M canal’s function was replaced by the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal in 1900. This canal reversed the flow of the Chicago River! Originally the Chicago River emptied into Lake Michigan, but during the Chicago population boom, illness spread quickly around Chicago because Chicagoans used the river like a sewer and the lake for drinking water. Engineers changed the course of the river to save Chicago drinking water. </p>

                    <p>In 1909, an architect named Burham developed the “Plan for Chicago”. This plan recommended an interconnected series of parks and widened roadways. One part of the plan was an improvement of the Lakefront. Burhan said, "The Lakefront right belongs to the people; not a foot of its shores should be appropriated to the exclusion of the people." Grant Park (originally named Lake Park) was built on debris left from the Great Chicago Fire. The plan also called for a double decker street to relieve congestion. This idea was realized in 1926 with the construction of Wacker Drive. </p>

                    <p>In 1979, Robert Cassidy wrote a piece for Chicago Magazine called “Our Friendless River” which brought to light the years of neglect the Chicago River experienced. It created a spark for renewed commitment to the watershed and the start of “Friends of The Chicago River.” Many projects have helped improve the health and beaty of the river sense this time. One such project, the Chicago Riverwalk, began construction in 2001. </p>
