vacation spot. 
◼ 
◼ 
Main home page (1 page)
    —This should include 
        a short intro to the subject and 
        perhaps a picture or two to get the visitor excited about the subject matter. 
            

Information (2 or more pages)—
    Include information on the subject that you feel 
would be relevant to the user 
        (history, resources, location, etc.). 
               
        
“About the Web Developer” (1 page)
    —Should be a short 2-3 paragraph bio of 
yourself, including your name. 
    Also mention what drew you to this particular vacation 
destination.

------NEXT------
1. They must share a clear, common navigation scheme (such as an identical list or navigation bar) 
that appears at the top of each page. 

All links within your web site must use relative paths. 

2. There must be a consistent, easily readable style across all pages, implemented using a single 
external style sheet 

(or two style sheets since one is a reset style sheet). 

3. Use external CSS only—no inline or embedded style! Your CSS file (excluding the reset style 
sheet) should be at least 20 lines of code and should reflect that you have spend four or more 
weeks on this web site. 


4. Every page that uses images must properly and clearly credit the sources of the images. 
    (Publicdomain images may be used with proper citation, but no copyrighted materials may be used 
without written permission of the owner.) 

5. Every page must have its HTML5 code documented with a comment (one or two sentences long 
is sufficient) 
    that describes the page’s content 
    and purpose in the web site. 

6. At least one page must include a table of some sort that is used for tabular data only (remember 
your semantic code). Examples of content for the table could include: ticket prices to a tourist 
destination, airfares, or special events with their dates. 
Depending on the subject you choose for your web site, this table may be a very natural thing to 
include, or it may seem somewhat artificial. However, something like this must be a part of your 
web site to demonstrate your mastery of table elements. If you have trouble thinking of what to 
do here, contact me. 


7. In keeping with SEO practices, every page should contain a descriptive title element, an h1 
element, and an h2 element.


8. Each page must include four or more of the following semantic HTML elements: main, header, 
footer, nav, aside, article, and section (and you must use these tags correctly!). 


9. At least one page must include an image file, and 

at least one page must include a list 
    (this does 
not include the page’s navigation). 

10. One of the pages should have a video clip included in it. It could be a direct MP4 or a clip from 
the internet (YouTube, Vimeo, etc…)  

11. You must change the default link and visited link states – no blue or purple underlined text! 


12. Every page’s HTML5 code must be readable and neatly formatted. 


13. Pages will be tested in multiple browsers (Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Google Chrome) and 
must work in all browsers.
